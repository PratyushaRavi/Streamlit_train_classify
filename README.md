# Streamlit 
## The fastest way to build web apps fro Machine Learning and Data science Applications

So I have built a custom Image classifier web app in which you can:</br>
-> Upload your image dataset and instantly train a Neural Network  with considerable accuracy with just a click!</br>
-> You can upload images to instantly get *prediction*</br>

**Dependencies to run**:
* It is recomended to install Anaconda and install all the dependecies in a virtual environment*.</br>

Installation link : [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)</br>

Details to create virtual environment: [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)</br>

Dependenies to have:</br>
*Numpy*</br>
*Tensorflow*</br>
*Pillow*</br>
*Streamlit*</br>

To run it on your local host:</br>
 `streamlit run streamlit_train_classify.py`</br>
or</br>
 `streamlit run {*//github link of streamlit_train_classify.py script*}`</br>

Have fun!
