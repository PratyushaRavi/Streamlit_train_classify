# Streamlit 
## The fastest way to build web apps fro Machine Learning and Data science Applications

So I have built a custom Image classifier web app in which you can:
-> Upload your image dataset and instantly train a Neural Network  with considerable accuracy with just a click!
-> You can upload images to instantly get *prediction *

**Dependencies to run**:
* It is recomended to install Anaconda and install all the dependecies in a virtual environment.*
-Installation link : [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
-Details to create virtual environment: [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

Dependenies to have:
*Numpy*
*Tensorflow*
*Pillow*
*Streamlit*

To run it on your local host:
 `streamlit run streamlit_train_classify.py`
or
 `streamlit run {*//github link of streamlit_train_classify.py script*}`

Have fun!
