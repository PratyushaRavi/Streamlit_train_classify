Streamlit 
It is the fastest way to build web apps fro Machine Learning and Data science Applications

So I have built a custom Image classifier web app
-> You can upload your image dataset and instantly train a Neural Network  with considerable accuracy.
-> You can instantly get prediction throught he model which was just trained

Dependenies to have:
Numpy
Tensorflow
Pillow
Streamlit

To run it on your local host:
>>> streamlit run streamlit_train_classify.py
or
>>> streamlit run {//github link of streamlit_train_classify.py script}

Have fun!
